# Broadway Lottery Automation

The goal of this project is to provide an easier way to sign up for broadway lotteries.

# Setup

1. Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your python 3 environment of choice.  (I like using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), but to each their own )

2. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (if you haven't already)

3. Install the [Chrome Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).  And make sure it's in your path.
